# Auto Select Pasted Text for VSCode

Boost your VSCode experience with **Auto Select Pasted Text**. This extension is perfect for developers frequently copying and pasting code snippets, especially from online sources or ChatGPT. Eliminate the manual re-selection hassle post-pasting. The extension ensures that every time you paste content, it's instantly selected, making the editing process more streamlined and efficient.

## 🌟 Features

- 📌 **Instant Highlight**: After pasting, your text is automatically highlighted. This allows for immediate operations, such as indenting, commenting, or other formatting tasks.

- 💼 **Smart Pasting & Deselection**: If you paste and then type, the extension smartly deselects the pasted content and positions the cursor at the end. This ensures a seamless transition between pasting and continuing to type. Moreover, the extension recognizes repeated pasting actions and appends content without overwriting the previous pastes.

- 📖 **Logging & Debugging**: Behind the scenes, the extension logs significant events, such as activations, paste commands, and selection changes. This is invaluable for developers seeking insights or debugging the extension's behavior.

## 🛠 Usage

Whenever you paste content, it will be automatically highlighted. This auto-selection functionality is designed to streamline common post-paste operations, enhancing your coding efficiency. Here are some of the immediate operations you can perform on the auto-selected text:

- **Indenting**: Quickly adjust the indentation of the pasted code by pressing `Tab` to indent or `Shift + Tab` to outdent.
- **Commenting**: Instantly comment out the pasted section using `Ctrl + /` (or `Cmd + /` on macOS).
- **Formatting**: If you have a formatter installed, you can format the selected code immediately with `Shift + Alt + F`.
- **Cut/Copy**: Decide to move the pasted content or duplicate it? Just use `Ctrl + X` to cut or `Ctrl + C` to copy without any extra selection steps.
- **Applying Snippets**: If you have code snippets or extensions that work on selected text, they can be applied right away.
- **Deletion**: Changed your mind about the pasted content? Simply press `Delete` or `Backspace` to remove the selected content.

After pasting, if you start typing, the auto-selected content will be deselected, and the cursor will position itself at the end, allowing for a seamless transition between pasting and typing.

This auto-selection feature aims to reduce the friction between pasting and editing, ensuring a smooth and efficient coding experience.
