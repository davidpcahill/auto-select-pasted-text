Boost your VSCode experience with **Auto Select Pasted Text**. This extension is perfect for developers frequently copying and pasting code snippets, especially from online sources or ChatGPT. Eliminate the manual re-selection hassle post-pasting. The extension ensures that every time you paste content, it's instantly selected, making the editing process more streamlined and efficient.

## 🌟 Features

This is invaluable for developers seeking insights or debugging the extension's behavior. Easily toggle logging on or off via the command palette or settings.
